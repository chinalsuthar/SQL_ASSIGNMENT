 Q8)What is the significance of “%” and “_” operators in the LIKE statement?
 ANS)the LIKE statement is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
     1) '%' Operator:The %  represents one or multiple characters in a string.
   eg: 'g%' - in this it will match the charachter that starts with g and then any no of charachters.
     2)' _ 'Operator:The _ represents a single character in a string.
      eg:'g__d'-it matches the character which starts with g and ends with d.

Q9) Explain normalization in the context of databases?
ANS)NORMALIZATION:-

-it is the process of organizing the data in the database.
-it divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
-the normal form is used to reduce redundancy(duplicasey) from the database table.
-it maintains integrity.
Integrity:-set of predefined rules that ensure the quality of information stored in a database.

TYPES OF NORMALIZATION:-
1) 1NF(first normal form):-
-A relation will be 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
-It states that an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values. It must hold only single-valued attribute.
EX:-Relation EMPLOYEE is not in 1NF because of multi-valued attribute EMP_PHONE.

2)2NF(Second Normal Form):-
-relation must be in 1NF.
-all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
-in this the table should not depend half on teacher id or subject it should fully depend on only on teacher id.
-there will be no partial dependency.

3)3NF(Third Normal Form):-
-A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and not contain any transitive partial dependency.
-If there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes,then the relation must be in third normal form.
-there will be no transitive partial dependency.

EX:- EMP_ZIP,EMP_STATE,EMP_CITY.
EMP_ID,EMP_NAME,EMP_ZIP.

4)BCNF(BOYCE CODD NORMAL FORM):-
-BCNF is the advance version of 3NF.it is stricter than 3NF.
-A table is in BCNF if every functional dependency X->Y,X is the super key of the table.
-For BCNF,the table should be in 3NF.and for every FD.LHS is super key.

EX:- EMP_ID->EMP_COUNTRY.
EMP_DEPT->{DEPT_TYPE,EMP_DEPT_NO}.

5)4NF(FOURTH NORMAL FORM):-
-A relation will be in 4NF if it is in boyce codd normal form and has no multi valued dependency.
-For a dependency A->B ,if for a single value of A ,multiple values of B exists ,then the relation will be a multi-valued dependency.

stu_id |  course   |   hobby
21     |  computer | dancing         
21     |  math     | singing
34     |  chemistry| dancing
74     |  biology  |  cricket   
59     |  physics  |  hockey 
in this the stu_id 21 has 2 course and 2 hobbies so it is multi valued(this should not happen)so we divide it in 2 tables

6)5NF(FIFTH NORMAL FORM):-
-A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless.
-5NF is satisfied when all the tables are broken into as many tables as possible in order to avoid rebundancy.
-5NF is also known as project-join normal form(PJ/NF).

Q11)What do you understand about DDL, DCL, and DML in MySQL? 
ANS)DDL:-it is said as DATA DEFINATION LANGUAGE.
   it changes the structure of a table like creating a atble,deleting , altering,etc 
 here are some commands:-
-truncate:-it will delete the entire data but the structure will remain the 	  same(truncate table employee)
-drop:-it will delete the table( drop table emp)
-create:- create table employee(id int);
-alter:-alter table emp add(address varchar(50));

 DML:-is said as DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE.
it is used to modify the database.it is responsible for all form of changes.
inert:-it is used to insert records(rows)
-UPDATE-it is used to do changes in the data
-DELETE- it is used to delete the single records(rows)
  
DCL:-It is said as DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE. It is used to grant and revoke permissions.

Q10)What does a join in MySQL mean? 
ANS)In SQL, a join is a command clause in the from clause of a query that combines records from two or more tables in a database.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************
Q12)What is the role of the MySQL JOIN clause in a query, and what are some common types of joins?
ANS)The role of MySQL JOIN clause in a query is that to join two or more table together in one table.
There are 5 types of joins:-
1)INNER JOIN:-
	a fundamental join operation that combines records from two or more tables based on matching values in a common field.
eg:-if in a table there is 1,2,4,5 and another table has 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 then it will only return 1,2,4,5 because only these no are there in both tables and 3 is not in one table so it will not come.

2)LEFT JOIN:-
a type of join also known as left outer join is a type of join operation that returns all records from the left table and any matching records from the right table.

eg : in this there is table one 12345 and another table 2346 then it will first return left side 12345
and another tables(right side) commen data 234.

3)RIGHT JOIN:-
a command that returns all rows from the table in the right join clause and only matching rows from the table in the from clause.

4)CROSS JOIN:-
a cross join is also known as cartesian product join, is a type of join in SQL that combines each row from one table with each row from another table.
eg:
table1       table2
 1               a
 2               b

cross join
1 a
1 b
1 c
2 a
2 b
2 c

5)FULL JOIN:-creates a new table by joining two tables as a whole.
